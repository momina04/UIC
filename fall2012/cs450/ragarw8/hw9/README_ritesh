After extracting the stub code, you'll need to create a file named "auth_key" and place your authentication key in this file.  Your authentication key can be viewed if you click on the "Your Profile" link on the VNS web interface.

To connect to your topology, after compiling the stub code, invoke sr as follows:

>./sr -t 1245 -s vns-1.stanford.edu -u <your_vns_user_name>

Please verify that the IP addresses for the interfaces match those in this email!

Your output upon connecting should look like this:

System status should be normal. Enjoy!

Secondly, please verify that you can see packets arriving to your topology when you try and ping one of your router interfaces.  To do this, connect to your topology as described above and try and ping eth0 (IP: 171.67.237.232).

> ping 171.67.237.232

If you see output from sr that looks like:

 *** -> Received packet of length 60
 *** -> Received packet of length 60
 *** -> Received packet of length 60

 everything is working!  If not, please email vns-support@lists.stanford.edu.

Good Luck!
