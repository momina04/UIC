collect...
{
for each host
{
 -traceroute every host.
 -collect per pair traceroute...FILE HostAB.traceroute //for Hosts A and B
}
}

post process
{
 -using nc find AS names for all IPs, remove duplicate AS names(choose first name or use to seperate multiple names for that IP)..file ip_ASNs.txt
 -map all ips to ASNs(take care of duplicate ASNs) in every pair trace route...file HostAB.post
 -remove duplicate ASNs in a single pair trace route..file  HostAB.post2 (input: HostAB.post1)
}



Once the data is collected, we need to process it to learn the following statistics:
What 30 AS:es are the most frequently occurring ASNs between our hosts? Take care not to double-count ASNs when they appear more than once in a route.
 -concatenate all files HostAB.post2 into a single file..count the no. of uniq ASN names..sort based on count..provide last 30 entries as answer
 


What 30 AS:es have the largest `degree' or 'number of neighboring ASNs'.
use file HostAB.post2
 -for each AS in ip_ASNs.txt
  {
    find the line no. on which AS occurs in(all the files HostAB.post2)
    if(lineno is first line)
        add ASN in next line to the list of its neighbours ASNname.neighbours 
    if(lineno is last line)
        add ASN in previous line to the list of its neighbours ASNname.neighbours 
    if(lineno is the middleline) //assert
        add ASN in previous and next line to the list of its neighbours ASNname.neighbours
  }
 -remove duplicates lines from each neighbours files to FILE ASNname.unique_neighbours
 wc -l *.unique_neighbours|sort -n -k 1|tail -n 30

What 30 AS:es have the largest number of observed hosts?
-use files HostAB.post
-concatenate all of them in a single file
-uniq -c |will give you counts of host for each uniq ASN Name
-sort -n -k1 |tail -n 30


What AS:es occur in all three lists above? Try googling for "ASxxxxx" to find out what networks these are!
