The hw8 grade was calculated by comparing how much the homework was close to
the correct solution. The sample REPORT.txt file was split into the following
four lists:

1) AS ids of most frequently occuring ASNs
2) AS ids with largest number of neighboring ASNs
3) AS ids with largest number of observed hosts
4) AS ids that occur in all three lists above

For each element above, the fractional overlap with the correct solution was
calculated as follows: The intersection of the homework set with the solution
set was calculated and then divided by 30 to get a fraction between 0 and 1.

The elements 1) 2) 3) and 4) in the score.txt file contain these fractions,
where 1.0 denotes a perfect overlap and 0.0 denotes no overlap.

Also, the elements 5) 6) 7) and 8) contain the number of AS ids in each
of the above lists.

The Total score was then calculated as follows:
If any of the lists 5) to 8) contained more than 0 ASNs, that would be worth 3 points.
The corresponding element in 1) to 4) was then set to 0.0. After that, each 
element from 1) to 4) greater than or equal to 0.50 earned 0.5 points with an additional
0.5 points if the element was also greater than or equal to 0.80.

The Total score is calculated as a sum of the above scored points.
