#1) Two reasonable scatterplots of pair-wise round-trip times.
	  1 point

#2) Two reasonable CDF plots for rtt and distance.
	  1 point
	
#3) Computed mean and standard deviation of speed of bits 
    over each set with explanation of any differences between the 
    measurement sets. For this question it is important to calculate 
    the mean and std.dev. of the actual speed of bits as opposed 
    to the mean and std.dev of rtt and distance.
	  1 point
	
#4) Estimation of maximum speed of bits with comparison to speed
    of light and explanation why are they different.
	  1 point
	
#5) List of servers with incorrect locations with explanation
    of reasoning.
	  0.5 points

#6) List of sites or countries with poor connectivity with an example and
	an explanation of reasoning.
	  0.5 points
	
#7) Location estimation of IP 68.86.95.9 with evidence used and explanation
    of reasoning. For full score, Chicago should be mentioned as the correct 
    answer along with explanation and reasoning.
