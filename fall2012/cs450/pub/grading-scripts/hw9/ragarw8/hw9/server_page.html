<h2>VNS App Server Website</h2>

<p>You've successfully loaded a small (<600B) webpage hosted on your VNS
topology's application server!</p>

<p>To stress your router a little more, try these:
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="photos.html">photos page</a> has 3 photos (~0.5MB total).
Your browser will (probably) simultaneously download these all at once.</li>
	<li>Download this <a href="big.jpg">big photo</a> to see how your router
handles larger file transfers.</li>
	<li>Look at <a href="src_info.dyn">this dynamic page</a> to see where you're sending packing from.</li>
</ul>
