TEST FOR pthread and select
=====================================
grep for pthread:
			//pthread_create(&thread,0,connect_to_peer,&peerlist[i]);

			//pthread_t thread;
			//pthread_create(&thread,0,connect_to_peer,&peeraddr);
	// create our output file, and set up a piece_status array, and a couple of pthread sync. variables

grep for select:
#include <sys/select.h>
        int rdy = select(FD_SETSIZE,&readset_copy,&writeset_copy,&exceptionset_copy, &timespec);
            if(FD_ISSET(peer->socket,&readset_copy)) 
            if(FD_ISSET(peer->socket,&writeset_copy)){
            if(FD_ISSET(peer->socket,&writeset_copy)){
